1) Write a Java program to create a class called "Cat" with instance variables name and age. Implement a default constructor that initializes the name to "Unknown" and the age to 0. Print the values of the variables.

2) Write a Java program to create a class called Dog with instance variables name and color. Implement a parameterized constructor that takes name and color as parameters and initializes the instance variables. Print the values of the variables.

3)Write a Java program to create an outer class called  Computer with an inner class Processor. The Processor class should have a method "displayDetails()" that prints the details of the processor (e.g., brand and speed). Create an instance of Processor from the Computer class and call the "displayDetails()" method.

4)Write a Java program to create a class called Shape with a method called getArea(). Create a subclass called Rectangle that overrides the getArea() method to calculate the area of a rectangle.

5)Write a Java program to create a class called Animal with a method named move(). Create a subclass called Cheetah that overrides the move() method to run.

6)Write a Java program to create a class known as Person with methods called getFirstName() and getLastName(). Create a subclass called Employee that adds a new method named getEmployeeId() and overrides the getLastName() method to include the employee's job title.

7)Write a Java program to create a base class Animal with methods eat() and sound(). Create three subclasses: Lion, Tiger, and Panther. Override the eat() method in each subclass to describe what each animal eats. In addition, override the sound() method to make a specific sound for each animal.

8)Write a Java program to create a class called Rectangle with private instance variables length and width. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify these variables.
